# Matching MLOps phases with classic retro arcade games

**Data Cleaning, Asteroids:**

Imagine you're behind the controls of a classic Asteroids game. In this scenario, each asteroid represents a piece of bad data — outliers, duplicates, or incomplete records that threaten to clutter your dataset. Your mission is to keep the playing field clear and safe by maneuvering and blasting away these rogue asteroids. Just as in the game, every missed asteroid can cause havoc. Data errors can lead to misinterpretations or faulty analysis. Precision and quick reflexes are key, by systematically eliminating these obstacles ensuring that only clean, useful data remains, ultimately clearing the path the overall success of your MLOps pipeline.

**Feature Engineering, Tetris:**

Imagine feature engineering as a game of Tetris. Just like in Tetris where you skillfully rotate and align falling blocks to clear lines, in feature engineering you arrange, transform, and combine raw features into a meaningful, structured dataset. Each engineered feature is like a well-placed Tetris piece that helps complete the overall picture and ensures that the subsequent steps have a solid foundation.

**Model Training and Evaluation, Space Invaders:**

Model training and evaluation could be likened to Space Invaders. In this scenario, each wave of invading aliens represents a batch of training data. As you shoot them down—tweaking weights and biases along the way—you’re essentially fighting through layers of complexity. The evaluation part is visible in how you adapt to the increasing pace and challenge. With each level, your model becomes more robust and better at warding off the next wave of errors.

**Model Deployment, Pac-Man:**

For model deployment, you might picture Retro Pac-Man. After careful preparation, you release your trained model into the wild (the maze) where it must navigate real-world data, gobbling up useful signals while avoiding ghosts that could represent unexpected system errors or challenges. The maze itself is the operational environment, and every turn is a deployment decision that could lead either to success or pitfall.

**Model Monitoring, Missile Command:**

Finally, model monitoring can be compared to Missile Command. Just as you constantly scan the skies for incoming missiles, model monitoring is the ongoing vigilance required to catch performance drifts, anomalies, or system failures before they cause significant harm. It’s all about having a responsive system that can intercept issues in real time, similar to how you protect cities in the game from being hit.
